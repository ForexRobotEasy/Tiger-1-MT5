## How It Works

The Tiger 1 MT5 Expert Advisor uses the following logic to execute trades:

1. **Initialization (OnInit):**
   - Set the trading parameters, including the symbol to trade (gold) and the timeframe (15 minutes).
   - Add the necessary indicators and their parameters, including a 14-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

2. **Start Function (OnTick):**
   - Check for a new trend by calculating the 14-period and 15-period EMAs.
   - Determine if it's an uptrend by comparing the values of the two EMAs.

3. **Execute Trades:**
   - If it's an uptrend and there are no open trades:
     - Open a buy trade with a specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit.
     - Print a message indicating the execution status of the trade.
   - If it's a downtrend and there are no open trades:
     - Open a sell trade with a specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit.
     - Print a message indicating the execution status of the trade.

4. **Deinitialization (OnDeinit):**
   - Perform necessary cleanup tasks.

5. **Fail-safe Mechanism (OnTrade):**
   - Check if a trade has resulted in a loss.
   - Calculate the grid size based on the account balance.
   - Open an additional trade in the opposite direction to recover the loss.
   - Print a message indicating the execution status of the additional trade.

Please note that this code is a sample and may require further customization or optimization to fit specific trading strategies or market conditions.
